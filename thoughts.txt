Synchronous stats

Event driven
	Spikes are handled one at a time through whole network
		lose some temporal info but less compute (how much of loss)
	spikes are handled in a delayed fashion. Causes multiple spikes in network at same time
		more computation cost but preserve temporal info (better in general)

Need to implement only FF LIF or other layers like Conv?

Too heavy for micro controller?
